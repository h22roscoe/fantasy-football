# Fantasy Football for ICUAFC

The aim is to build a little app for looking at the players points over the season
and create teams of other IC players to rank them.

## Setup

* Get [MongoDB](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/quick-start/) set up
* Run it
* Run `node server.js` to start up the back end
* Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## The tools used

Using the MEAN stack as I am familiar with it.

Angular 1.5.8 so making use of components on the front end within the `app` directory.
